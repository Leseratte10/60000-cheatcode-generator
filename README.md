# 60000 cheatcode generator

This tool was quickly hacked together by Leseratte. 
It wasn't really planned to opensource this tool so the source code is kinda crappy. 

For more information see [this forum thread](https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Thread/59717-BETA-Error-60000-fix-for-all-Wii-games/). 

Just run the program with the path to a Wii game DOL file as parameter, 
and the tool will print a Gecko cheatcode that should fix error 60000 
for your particular game. 

If that cheat code doesn't work (or if the tool fails to generate a cheat code), 
please open an issue.

This tool is released under the AGPL version 3 license.
